        <h2> Browser Compatibility Report</h2>
        <p class = "justify">
            The web page was developed using the google chrome browser for testing. Media width queries were used for the container classes (the main sections and divs of the website), 
            to ensure responsive resizing based on the width of the user's screen.<br>
            Additionally, media queries were used for the photo album's output, to transform the format from a side-by-side (image &#60;-&#62; content), to a top-down format when the
            screen width becomes too small. Therefore, the content does not become too small to read when the screen is small.<br>
            To ensure good printing of the document, "media print" queries were used to enforce some extra rules regarding image breaking and table breaking on page breaks. The background 
            color was also reverted to pure white to prevent excessive printer ink consumption.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Browser Testing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Chrome: </strong> Great responsiveness, good printing results. No errors encountered when resizing the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Edge: </strong> Good responsiveness, good printing results. No errors encountered when resizing the page.</li>
